A library made by me which allows the storing of data in format inspired by JSON and Stellaris (Paradox) files.

Compared to JSON (using simplejson library), this library has:
- extremely slow read speeds 
- similar write speeds with 0 indents
- faster write speeds with indents

Therefore, do NOT use this in an environment that requires reading files fast.
